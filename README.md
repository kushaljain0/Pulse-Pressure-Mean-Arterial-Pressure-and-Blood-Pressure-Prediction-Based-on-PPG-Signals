# Pulse-Pressure-Mean-Arterial-Pressure-and-Blood-Pressure-Prediction-Based-on-PPG-Signals
The major problem with PPG signals is motion artifacts, which can corrupt the original signal.  The project aims to use features extracted from PPG signals to construct a machine-learning model that can predict Pulse Pressure (PP), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), and Blood Pressure (BP).
